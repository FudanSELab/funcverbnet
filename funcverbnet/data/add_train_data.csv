Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__-1
Bound property name for messagesStopCellEditing.	__label__-1
What this means in practical terms is that an application that starts to use SAAJ APIs on a tree after manipulating it using DOM APIs must assume that the tree has been translated into an all SAAJ tree and that any references to objects within the tree that were obtained using DOM APIs are no longer valid.	__label__-1

The caller is thus free to modify the returned array.	__label__-1
This method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.	__label__-1
Returns Object[] an array containing all of the elements in this collection	__label__-1
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection.	__label__-1
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order.	__label__-1
"The returned array will be ""safe"" in that no references to it are maintained by this collection."	__label__-1
(In other words, this method must allocate a new array even if this collection is backed by an array).	__label__-1
Returns the component at the specified index.	__label__-1
This method returns the time-zone used.	__label__-1
Gets the time-zone being used to create dates and times.	__label__-1
This policy specifies whether the created POA retains active servants in an Active Object Map.	__label__-1
For example, a Permissions object might have a FilePermissionCollection for all the FilePermission objects, a SocketPermissionCollection for all the SocketPermission objects, and so on.	__label__-1
That is, its members are each a homogeneous PermissionCollection.	__label__-1
For example, Permissions is a PermissionCollection subclass that represents a collection of PermissionCollections.	__label__-1
A PermissionCollection may also be heterogeneous.	__label__-1
For example, the Permissions object uses a default PermissionCollection implementation that stores the permission objects in a Hashtable.	__label__-1
If newPermissionCollection returns null, the PermissionCollection is free to store the permission in any type of PermissionCollection it desires (one using a Hashtable, one using a Vector, etc.).	__label__-1
Whenever a permission is added to a heterogeneous PermissionCollection such as Permissions, and the PermissionCollection doesn't yet contain a PermissionCollection of the specified permission's type, the PermissionCollection should call the newPermissionCollection method on the permission's class to see if it requires a special PermissionCollection.	__label__-1
Its add method adds a permission to the appropriate collection.	__label__-1
Furthermore, Enumerations returned via the elements method are not fail-fast.	__label__-1

When the method acceptChanges executes successfully, in addition to writing changes to the data source, it makes the values in the current row be the values in the original row.	__label__-1
Depending on the synchronization level of the SyncProvider implementation being used, the writer will compare the original values with those in the data source to check for conflicts.	__label__-1
When there is a conflict, the RIOptimisticProvider implementation, for example, throws a SyncProviderException and does not write anything to the data source.	__label__-1
An application may choose to catch the SyncProviderException object and retrieve the SyncResolver object it contains.	__label__-1
Propagates row update, insert and delete changes made to this CachedRowSet object to the underlying data source.	__label__-1
Standard CachedRowSet implementations should use the SyncFactory singleton to obtain a SyncProvider instance providing a RowSetWriter object (writer).	__label__-1
The writer will attempt to propagate changes made in this CachedRowSet object back to the data source.	__label__-1
The SyncResolver object lists the conflicts row by row and sets a lock on the data source to avoid further conflicts while the current conflicts are being resolved.	__label__-1
Further, for each conflict, it provides methods for examining the conflict and setting the value that should be persisted in the data source.	__label__-1
This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)	__label__-1
MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public method.	__label__-1
Gets the location of this component in the form of a point specifying the component's top-left corner.	__label__-1

Constructs a ConnectionEvent object initialized with the given PooledConnection object and SQLException object.	__label__-1
Returns a Collection object containing the RowSet objects that have been added to this JoinRowSet object.	__label__-1
If no such listeners exist, this method returns an empty array.	__label__-1
For example, you can query a TextField t for its action listeners with the following code: ActionListener[] als = (ActionListener[])(t.getListeners(ActionListener.class)); .	__label__-1
You can specify the listenerType argument with a class literal, such as FooListener.class.	__label__-1
FooListeners are registered using the addFooListener method.	__label__-1
Returns an array of all the objects currently registered as FooListeners upon this TextField.	__label__-1
If the CORBA system exception org.omg.CORBA.portable.UnknownException is thrown, then the stub does one of the following: (1) Translates it to org.omg.CORBA.UNKNOWN.	__label__-1

This returns a color with rgb values of 102, 102, and 153, respectively.	__label__-1
When constructing a Color with an explicit alpha or getting the color/alpha components of a Color, the color components are never premultiplied by the alpha component.	__label__-1
For further information on sRGB, see http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/Graphics/Color/sRGB.html .	__label__-1
The Color class is used to encapsulate colors in the default sRGB color space or colors in arbitrary color spaces identified by a ColorSpace.	__label__-1
An alpha value of 1.0 or 255 means that the color is completely opaque and an alpha value of 0 or 0.0 means that the color is completely transparent.	__label__-1

If the mouseX and mouseY are in the expand/collapse region of the row, this will toggle the row.	__label__-1
If true, this glyph absorbs all extra space at this and lower priority levels when it grows.	__label__-1
In this fashion, the concrete visitor can control the ordering of traversal over the component elements with respect to the additional processing; for example, consistently calling super.visitXYZ at the start of the overridden methods will yield a preorder traversal, etc.	__label__-1

Represents a formal type parameter of a generic class, interface, method, or constructor element.	__label__-1
In order to call this method, a RowSet object must have implemented the RowSetInternal interface and registered this RowSetReader object as its reader.	__label__-1
Reads the new contents of the calling RowSet object.	__label__-1
The readData method adds rows to the caller.	__label__-1
The readData method is invoked internally by the RowSet.execute method for rowsets that support the reader/writer paradigm.	__label__-1
In general, a reader may invoke any of the rowset's methods, with one exception.	__label__-1
It can be implemented in a wide variety of ways and can even populate the caller with rows from a nonrelational data source.	__label__-1
Also, when a reader invokes RowSet methods, no listeners are notified; that is, no RowSetEvent objects are generated and no RowSetListener methods are invoked.	__label__-1
Calling the method execute will cause an SQLException to be thrown because execute may not be called recursively.	__label__-1
Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.	__label__-1
Returns the window title background color of the current theme.	__label__-1
Processes action events occurring on this text field by dispatching them to any registered ActionListener objects.	__label__-1
This method is not called unless action events are enabled for this component.	__label__-1
Action events are enabled when one of the following occurs: An ActionListener object is registered via addActionListener.	__label__-1
Action events are enabled via enableEvents.	__label__-1
Returns a new NumberFormat instance which formats integer values for the specified locale.	__label__-1
Each CachedRowSet object's SyncProvider contains a Connection object from the original ResultSet or JDBC properties passed to it.	__label__-1
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction back to the last Savepoint transaction marker.	__label__-1
This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled.	__label__-1
It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__-1
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__-1
For example, this exception could be raised if an error occurred when trying to register a resource.	__label__-1
Unless otherwise specified, methods in this package will throw a NullPointerException if given a null argument.	__label__-1
Identifies the Latin-1 (European) and extended range, and Latin-1 (European) decimal base.	__label__-1
This implementation visits a UnionType by calling defaultAction.	__label__-1
(This is useful in determining the length of this collection only if the caller knows that this collection does not contain any null elements.)	__label__-1
If this collection makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order.	__label__-1
Like the toArray() method, this method acts as bridge between array-based and collection-based APIs.	__label__-1
Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs.	__label__-1
Returns an array containing all of the elements in this collection; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.	__label__-1
If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.	__label__-1
Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this collection.	__label__-1
If this collection fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this collection), the element in the array immediately following the end of the collection is set to null.	__label__-1
Constructs an ActivateFailedException with the specified detail message.	__label__-1
A Context object may be named for purposes of specifying a starting search scope.	__label__-1
Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer.	__label__-1
The following code can be used to dump the collection into a newly allocated array of String: String[] y = x.toArray(new String[0]); .	__label__-1
The returned string may be empty but may not be null.	__label__-1
A type-safe enumeration of possible orientations.	__label__-1
Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in any class or interface in this package will cause a NullPointerException to be thrown.	__label__-1
Provides classes for networking applications.	__label__-1
These classes include factories for creating sockets.	__label__-1
In the default sRGB space.	__label__-1
The SQL query returned by this method is used by RowSet methods such as execute and populate, which may be implemented by any class that extends the BaseRowSet abstract class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces.	__label__-1
Flips to the previous card of the specified container.	__label__-1
If selfChange is true, only delivers the notification to the observer if it has indicated that it wants to receive self-change notifications by implementing deliverSelfNotifications() to return true.	__label__-1
Computes the hash code for this Color.	__label__-1
Index to location.	__label__-1
When the POA has the NON_RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are ServantLocators.	__label__-1
When the POA uses the ServantLocator interface, immediately after performing the operation invocation on the servant returned by preinvoke, the POA will invoke postinvoke on the servant manager, passing the ObjectId value and the Servant value as parameters (among others).	__label__-1
Updates the expanded state of all the descendants of path by getting the expanded descendants from the tree and forwarding to the tree state.	__label__-1
This method should be used when RowSet does not already have a match column set.	__label__-1
If compArray is null, an array with length equal to the number of components in cspace is created for the return value.	__label__-1
Otherwise, compArray must have at least this length, and it is filled in with the components and returned.	__label__-1
This might be confusing for the code calling createMBean() or registerMBean(), as such code might assume that MBean registration has failed when such an exception is raised.	__label__-1
However, throwing an exception in postRegister will not change the state of the MBean: if the MBean was already registered (registrationDone is true), the MBean will remain registered.	__label__-1
If the implementation of this method throws a RuntimeException or an Error, the MBean Server will rethrow those inside a RuntimeMBeanException or RuntimeErrorException, respectively.	__label__-1
Allows the MBean to perform any operations needed after having been registered in the MBean server or after the registration has failed.	__label__-1
"See ""Package Specification"" in javax.xml.bind.package javadoc for additional common information."	__label__-1

For the tray icon that is not yet added to the system tray, the returned size is equal to the result of the SystemTray.getTrayIconSize().	__label__-1
Due to native limitations the Toolkit object may report a particular state as supported, however at the same time the Toolkit object will be unable to apply the state to a given frame.	__label__-1
Note that supporting a given concept is a platform- dependent feature.	__label__-1
This circumstance has two following consequences: Only the return value of false for the present method actually indicates that the given state is not supported.	__label__-1
Atomically increments by one the current value.	__label__-1
Returns whether Toolkit supports this state for Frames.	__label__-1
In other words, the rule of thumb is that only queries with a single frame state constant as an argument are meaningful.	__label__-1

One use of this is to tell a cursor that it should retry its network request after it reported an error.	__label__-1
The structure of each bundle is entirely defined by the cursor.	__label__-1
This is an out-of-band way for the the user of a cursor to communicate with the cursor.	__label__-1
Types should be compared using the utility methods in Types.	__label__-1
Also represented are wildcard type arguments, the signature and return types of executables, and pseudo-types corresponding to packages and to the keyword void.	__label__-1
Types include primitive types, declared types (class and interface types), array types, type variables, and the null type.	__label__-1
Represents a type in the Java programming language.	__label__-1
Using instanceof is not necessarily a reliable idiom for determining the effective class of an object in this modeling hierarchy since an implementation may choose to have a single object implement multiple TypeMirror subinterfaces.	__label__-1
To implement operations based on the class of an TypeMirror object, either use a visitor or use the result of the getKind() method.	__label__-1
There is no guarantee that any particular type will always be represented by the same object.	__label__-1
Thus, the specified values are returned directly even if they are null.	__label__-1
"Classes ClassLoader, Process, ProcessBuilder, Runtime, SecurityManager, and System provide ""system operations"" that manage the dynamic loading of classes, creation of external processes, host environment inquiries such as the time of day, and enforcement of security policies."	__label__-1
The classes String, StringBuffer, and StringBuilder similarly provide commonly used operations on character strings.	__label__-1
These classes also provide a number of methods for converting among primitive values, as well as supporting such standard methods as equals and hashCode.	__label__-1
An object of type Double, for example, contains a field whose type is double, representing that value in such a way that a reference to it can be stored in a variable of reference type.	__label__-1
The class Math provides commonly used mathematical functions such as sine, cosine, and square root.	__label__-1
The Void class is a non-instantiable class that holds a reference to a Class object representing the type void.	__label__-1

Description copied from class: ComponentUI	__label__-1
It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__-1
See the section meaning of minor codes to see the minor codes for this exception.	__label__-1
This exception is raised if communication is lost while an operation is in progress, after the request was sent by the client, but before the reply from the server has been returned to the client.	__label__-1
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__-1
Returns the supported cursor dimension which is closest to the desired sizes.	__label__-1
Default JComponent constructor.	__label__-1
Systems which don't support custom cursors will return a dimension of 0, 0.	__label__-1
Note: if an image is used whose dimensions don't match a supported size (as returned by this method), the Toolkit implementation will attempt to resize the image to a supported size.	__label__-1
Since converting low-resolution images is difficult, no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn't a supported size.	__label__-1

Creates an sRGB color with the specified combined RGBA value consisting of the alpha component in bits 24-31, the red component in bits 16-23, the green component in bits 8-15, and the blue component in bits 0-7.	__label__-1
If the component elements should be traversed in some other order, instead of calling super.visitXYZ, an overriding visit method should call scan with the elements in the desired order.	__label__-1
When a subclass overrides a visitXYZ method, the new method can cause the enclosed elements to be scanned in the default way by calling super.visitXYZ.	__label__-1
When such an exception occurs, a NamingExceptionEvent is fired to notify the listener.	__label__-1

Returns the pixel bounds of the glyph at index when this GlyphVector is rendered in a Graphics with the given FontRenderContext at the given location.	__label__-1
The usage is subject to the following constraints: If the collection item type (for collection property) or property type (for single valued property) is JAXBElement, then @XmlElementRef}.name() and @XmlElementRef.namespace() must point an element factory method with an @XmlElementDecl annotation in a class annotated with @XmlRegistry (usually ObjectFactory class generated by the schema compiler) : @XmlElementDecl.name() must equal @XmlElementRef.name() @XmlElementDecl.namespace() must equal @XmlElementRef.namespace().	__label__-1
The presence of @XmlElementRef annotation on an element property indicates that the element name from JAXBElement instance be used instead of deriving an XML element name from the JavaBean property name.	__label__-1
The Holder for ULongSeq.	__label__-1
Fetches the character attributes in effect at the current location of the caret, or null.	__label__-1
This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)	__label__-1

If listener l is null, no exception is thrown and no action is performed.	__label__-1
Visits a type parameter element.	__label__-1
Classes implementing this interface are used to operate on a value when the type of that value is unknown at compile time.	__label__-1
When a visitor is passed to a value's accept method, the visitXYZ method applicable to that value is invoked.	__label__-1
A visitor of the values of annotation type elements, using a variant of the visitor design pattern.	__label__-1
Unlike a standard visitor which dispatches based on the concrete type of a member of a type hierarchy, this visitor dispatches based on the type of data stored; there are no distinct subclasses for storing, for example, boolean values versus int values.	__label__-1
Therefore, visitor classes directly implementing this interface may be source incompatible with future versions of the platform.	__label__-1
Classes implementing this interface may or may not throw a NullPointerException if the additional parameter p is null; see documentation of the implementing class for details.	__label__-1
WARNING: It is possible that methods will be added to this interface to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language.	__label__-1

Methods such as execute and populate must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 RowSet interfaces.	__label__-1
The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this RowSet object's command when the method execute is called.	__label__-1
When a very large binary value is input to a LONGVARBINARY parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a java.io.InputStream object.	__label__-1
This method throws an SQLException object if the number of bytes read and sent to the database is not equal to length.	__label__-1
Sets the designated parameter to the given java.io.InputStream object, which will have the specified number of bytes.	__label__-1
Calls made to the method getParams after setBinaryStream has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set.	__label__-1

"Constant for the ""+"" key."	__label__-1
This permission should be used only during testing, or in extremely rare cases where an application or applet is completely trusted and adding the necessary permissions to the policy is prohibitively cumbersome.	__label__-1
The AllPermission is a permission that implies all other permissions.	__label__-1
Note: Granting AllPermission should be done with extreme care, as it implies all other permissions.	__label__-1
Thus, it grants code the ability to run with security disabled.	__label__-1
Extreme caution should be taken before granting such a permission to code.	__label__-1
Gets the current value at position i.	__label__-1
This package implements DOM-specific transformation APIs.	__label__-1
If a node is specified, it should be one of the following: Document, Element, or DocumentFragment.	__label__-1
The DOMLocator node may be passed to TransformerException objects, and retrieved by trying to cast the result of the TransformerException.getLocator() method.	__label__-1
If the result is a Document, the output of the transformation must have a single element root to set as the document element.	__label__-1
Constant for the Hiragana function key.	__label__-1
A URL Connection to a Java ARchive (JAR) file or an entry in a JAR file.	__label__-1
The example above is a JAR URL which refers to a JAR entry.	__label__-1
for example: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/COM/foo/Quux.class Jar URLs should be used to refer to a JAR file or entries in a JAR file.	__label__-1
"For example: URL url = new URL(""jar:file:/home/duke/duke.jar!/""); JarURLConnection jarConnection = (JarURLConnection)url.openConnection(); Manifest manifest = jarConnection.getManifest(); ."	__label__-1
If the entry name is omitted, the URL refers to the whole JAR file: jar:http://www.foo.com/bar/baz.jar!/ Users should cast the generic URLConnection to a JarURLConnection when they know that the URL they created is a JAR URL, and they need JAR-specific functionality.	__label__-1
It is not possible to get a OutputStream to modify or write to the underlying JAR file using this class.	__label__-1
JarURLConnection instances can only be used to read from JAR files.	__label__-1
When constructing a JAR url via new URL(context, spec), the following rules apply: if there is no context URL and the specification passed to the URL constructor doesn't contain a separator, the URL is considered to refer to a JarFile.	__label__-1
Returns E the head of this deque, or null if this deque is empty	__label__-1
Retrieves and removes the first element of this deque, or returns null if this deque is empty.	__label__-1

Returns a hashcode for this ImageGraphicAttribute.	__label__-1
A mixin interface for an element that has a qualified name.	__label__-1
Note: Because no markup is recognized within a CDATASection, character numeric references cannot be used as an escape mechanism when serializing.	__label__-1
Therefore, action needs to be taken when serializing a CDATASection with a character encoding where some of the contained characters cannot be represented.	__label__-1
Sets the designated parameter to the given java.lang.BigDecimal value.	__label__-1
Note, however, that some code conversion libraries at the time of writing do not return an error or exception when a character is missing from the encoding, making the task of ensuring that data is not corrupted on serialization more difficult.	__label__-1
Therefore, the values returned by this method are guaranteed to be meaningful only for KEY_TYPED events.	__label__-1

If this Class represents either the Object class, an interface type, an array type, a primitive type, or void, the return value is null.	__label__-1
If this Class object represents a type whose declaration does not explicitly indicate an annotated superclass, then the return value is an AnnotatedType object representing an element with no annotations.	__label__-1
Reads a WebRowSet object in its XML format from the given Reader object.	__label__-1
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this RowSet object that its entire contents have changed.	__label__-1
An application should never invoke this method directly.	__label__-1

This class serves as a parameter block to the Instrumentation.redefineClasses method.	__label__-1
MOUSE_DRAGGED events will continue to be delivered to the component where the drag originated until the mouse button is released (regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the component).	__label__-1
Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__-1

Package Specification Input Method Framework Specification Input Method Client API Reference Related Documentation For overviews, tutorials, examples, guides, and tool documentation, please see: Input Method Framework Overview Input Method Client API Tutorial	__label__-1
However, the framework also supports input methods for other languages and the use of entirely different input mechanisms, such as handwriting or speech recognition.	__label__-1
They are commonly used to enter Japanese, Chinese, or Korean - languages using thousands of different characters - on keyboards with far fewer keys.	__label__-1
This package enables text editing components to receive text input through input methods.	__label__-1
Provides classes and interfaces for the input method framework.	__label__-1
Sets the command string used for action events.	__label__-1
When the POA has the RETAIN policy it uses servant managers that are ServantActivators.	__label__-1
Serialization notes: The LogRecord class is serializable.	__label__-1
Because objects in the parameters array may not be serializable, during serialization all objects in the parameters array are written as the corresponding Strings (using Object.toString).	__label__-1
Note that if the client application has not specified an explicit source method name and source class name, then the LogRecord class will infer them automatically when they are first accessed (due to a call on getSourceMethodName or getSourceClassName) by analyzing the call stack.	__label__-1
Therefore, if a logging Handler wants to pass off a LogRecord to another thread, or to transmit it over RMI, and if it wishes to subsequently obtain method name or class name information it should call one of getSourceClassName or getSourceMethodName to force the values to be filled in.	__label__-1
LogRecord objects are used to pass logging requests between the logging framework and individual log Handlers.	__label__-1
When a LogRecord is passed into the logging framework it logically belongs to the framework and should no longer be used or updated by the client application.	__label__-1
The method annotated with PostConstruct MUST be invoked even if the class does not request any resources to be injected.	__label__-1
This annotation MUST be supported on all classes that support dependency injection.	__label__-1
This method MUST be invoked before the class is put into service.	__label__-1
The PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization.	__label__-1
- The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.	__label__-1
- The return type of the method MUST be void.	__label__-1
The method on which the PostConstruct annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following criteria - - The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of EJB interceptors in which case it takes an InvocationC ontext object as defined by the EJB specification.	__label__-1
Only one method can be annotated with this annotation.	__label__-1
Depending on the Toolkit implementation, different EventQueues may be returned for different applets.	__label__-1
Interface implemented by an MBean that emits Notifications.	__label__-1
- The method MUST NOT be static except for the application client.	__label__-1
- The method on which PostConstruct is applied MAY be public, protected, package private or private.	__label__-1
Calls made to the method getParams after setAsciiStream has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set.	__label__-1
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.	__label__-1
Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is element number parameterIndex -1.	__label__-1
In other words, if the input stream being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams.	__label__-1
Returns all the field values in the descriptor as an array of Objects.	__label__-1
Converts the digits in the text that occur between start and start + count, using the provided context.	__label__-1
This method throws the exception BAD_OPERATION under two conditions: the type of the element contained in the Any object is not X the method extract_X is called before the value field of the Any object has been set There are distinct method pairs for each primitive IDL data type (insert_long and extract_long, insert_string and extract_string, and so on).	__label__-1
This should very rarely pose a problem since these attributes are typically used only in special circumstances and are unlikely to be serialized.	__label__-1
The color gray.	__label__-1
In the default sRGB space.	__label__-1
Exceptions thrown by JMX implementations.	__label__-1
Note that the method insert_X also resets the Any object's type field if necessary.	__label__-1
The interface for an annotation processor.	__label__-1
Indicates that a field defining a constant value may be referenced from native code.	__label__-1
The annotation may be used as a hint by tools that generate native header files to determine whether a header file is required, and if so, what declarations it should contain.	__label__-1
The interface to a Diffie-Hellman private key.	__label__-1
The length of the duration is stored using two fields - seconds and nanoseconds.	__label__-1
Constructs a KeyEvent object.	__label__-1
The total duration is defined by calling this method and getSeconds().	__label__-1
The nanoseconds part is a value from 0 to 999,999,999 that is an adjustment to the length in seconds.	__label__-1
A negative duration is expressed by the negative sign of the seconds part.	__label__-1
A Duration represents a directed distance between two points on the time-line.	__label__-1
A duration of -1 nanosecond is stored as -1 seconds plus 999,999,999 nanoseconds.	__label__-1
Accordingly, behavioral parameters in stream pipelines whose source might not be concurrent should never modify the stream's data source.	__label__-1
Such parameters are always instances of a functional interface such as Function, and are often lambda expressions or method references.	__label__-1
A behavioral parameter is said to interfere with a non-concurrent data source if it modifies, or causes to be modified, the stream's data source.	__label__-1

The equals method implements an equivalence relation on non-null object references: It is reflexive: for any non-null reference value x, x.equals(x) should return true.	__label__-1
"Indicates whether some other object is ""equal to"" this one."	__label__-1
It is transitive: for any non-null reference values x, y, and z, if x.equals(y) returns true and y.equals(z) returns true, then x.equals(z) should return true.	__label__-1
It is symmetric: for any non-null reference values x and y, x.equals(y) should return true if and only if y.equals(x) returns true.	__label__-1
For any non-null reference value x, x.equals(null) should return false.	__label__-1
It is consistent: for any non-null reference values x and y, multiple invocations of x.equals(y) consistently return true or consistently return false, provided no information used in equals comparisons on the objects is modified.	__label__-1
Note that it is generally necessary to override the hashCode method whenever this method is overridden, so as to maintain the general contract for the hashCode method, which states that equal objects must have equal hash codes.	__label__-1
The equals method for class Object implements the most discriminating possible equivalence relation on objects; that is, for any non-null reference values x and y, this method returns true if and only if x and y refer to the same object (x == y has the value true).	__label__-1
Returns boolean true if this object is the same as the obj argument; false otherwise.	__label__-1
Parameters o Object: the reference object with which to compare.	__label__-1

"If a security manager is present, and the caller's class loader is not null and the caller's class loader is not the same as or an ancestor of the class loader for the class whose class loader is requested, then this method calls the security manager's checkPermission method with a RuntimePermission(""getClassLoader"") permission to ensure it's ok to access the class loader for the class."	__label__-1
This method will return null in such implementations if this class was loaded by the bootstrap class loader.	__label__-1
An implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return in response to a signal, or over indicating the elapse of the specified waiting time.	__label__-1
Typically, an exception will be thrown (such as IllegalMonitorStateException) and the implementation must document that fact.	__label__-1
Implementation Considerations The current thread is assumed to hold the lock associated with this Condition when this method is called.	__label__-1
In either case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.	__label__-1
True if the root node is displayed, false if its children are the highest visible nodes.	__label__-1

Returns the tooltip string associated with this TrayIcon.	__label__-1
Note that if the event parameter is null the behavior is unspecified and may result in an exception.	__label__-1
This exception indicates that a violation of a dynamically checked type constraint was detected.	__label__-1
This exception can be thrown by the generated setter methods of the schema derived Java content classes.	__label__-1
However, since fail-fast validation is an optional feature for JAXB Providers to support, not all setter methods will throw this exception when a type constraint is violated.	__label__-1
If this exception is throw while invoking a fail-fast setter, the value of the property is guaranteed to remain unchanged, as if the setter were never called.	__label__-1
In addition, the returned ResultSet object should have the following properties: ResultSet.TYPE_SCROLL_INSENSITIVE ResultSet.CONCUR_UPDATABLE	__label__-1
Returns a ResultSet object containing the original value for the current row only of this CachedRowSet object.	__label__-1

"Alternatively, the property could be set in the application by using the following code: System.setProperty(""sun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons"", ""true""); ."	__label__-1
This setting could be done on the application startup by the following command: java -Dsun.awt.enableExtraMouseButtons=false Application .	__label__-1
If not set by the time of the Toolkit class initialization, this property will be initialized with true.	__label__-1
before the Toolkit class initialization.	__label__-1
Changing this value after the Toolkit class initialization will have no effect.	__label__-1

This makes it possible to decouple configuration from KeyStore object creation and e.g.	__label__-1
delay a password prompt until it is needed.	__label__-1
Sets whether this window should always be above other windows.	__label__-1
When an always-on-top window is sent toBack, its always-on-top state is set to false.	__label__-1
"When this method is called on a window with a value of true, and the window is visible and the platform supports always-on-top for this window, the window is immediately brought forward, ""sticking"" it in the top-most position."	__label__-1
When the window is later shown, it will be always-on-top.	__label__-1
Parameters oldPosition int: the position that we're moving from newPosition int: the position that we're moving to Returns boolean true if the move is successful, false otherwise	__label__-1
If it returns false the move function will also do so and the cursor will scroll to the beforeFirst position.	__label__-1
This function is called every time the cursor is successfully scrolled to a new position, giving the subclass a chance to update any state it may have.	__label__-1
This exception is raised whenever meaningful communication is not possible between client and server native code sets.	__label__-1
It can also be used with the following annotations at the package level: XmlJavaTypeAdapter.	__label__-1

If the bean's state can be expressed using only the no-argument constructor and public getter and setter methods for properties, no special knowledge is required.	__label__-1
If you need (or choose) to provide a persistence delegate for a bean, you can do so either by using a DefaultPersistenceDelegate instance or by creating your own subclass of PersistenceDelegate.	__label__-1
All classes provided in the JDK that descend from java.awt.Component, as well as all their properties, automatically have persistence delegates.	__label__-1
Otherwise, you need to implement your own persistence delegate, for which you're likely to need the following classes: PersistenceDelegate The abstract class from which all persistence delegates descend.	__label__-1
If the only reason a bean needs a persistence delegate is because you want to invoke the bean's constructor with property values as arguments, you can create the bean's persistence delegate with the one-argument DefaultPersistenceDelegate constructor.	__label__-1

Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number parameterIndex is parameterIndex -1.	__label__-1
In other words, if the second placeholder parameter is being set to null, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by getParams.	__label__-1
The parameter number is indicated by an element's position in the array returned by the method getParams, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on.	__label__-1
Calls made to the method getParams after this version of setNull has been called will return an Object array containing the parameter values that have been set.	__label__-1

Note that it is valid for both isDateBased() and isTimeBased() to return false, such as when representing a unit like 36 hours.	__label__-1
Checks if this unit represents a component of a time.	__label__-1
The reader for this CachedRowSet object will use conn to establish a connection to the data source so that it can execute the rowset's command and read data from the the resulting ResultSet object into this CachedRowSet object.	__label__-1
This method also closes conn after it has populated this CachedRowSet object.	__label__-1
Populates this CachedRowSet object with data, using the given connection to produce the result set from which the data will be read.	__label__-1
This method should close any database connections that it creates to ensure that this CachedRowSet object is disconnected except when it is reading data from its data source or writing data to its data source.	__label__-1
If this method is called when an implementation has already been populated, the contents and the metadata are (re)set.	__label__-1

The pixel data referenced by the specified URL must be in one of the following formats: GIF, JPEG or PNG.	__label__-1
Returns an image which gets pixel data from the specified URL.	__label__-1
Since the mechanism required to facilitate this sharing of Image objects may continue to hold onto images that are no longer in use for an indefinite period of time, developers are encouraged to implement their own caching of images by using the createImage variant wherever available.	__label__-1
The underlying toolkit attempts to resolve multiple requests with the same URL to the same returned Image.	__label__-1
Previously loaded image data can be manually discarded by calling the flush method on the returned Image.	__label__-1
If the image data stored at the specified URL changes, the Image object returned from this method may still contain stale information which was fetched from the URL after a prior call.	__label__-1
This method will return null if this component is currently not displayable.	__label__-1
Creates a graphics context for this component.	__label__-1

This class represents a datagram packet.	__label__-1
You may expect to see exceptions if these parameters are used.	__label__-1
Unless explicitly stated, null values or empty Strings are not valid parameters for the methods in this package.	__label__-1
If so, the method calls the security manager's checkPermission method with the url.openConnection().getPermission() permission to ensure that the access to the image is allowed.	__label__-1
Constructs a new, initially invisible window with the specified Window as its owner.	__label__-1
Parameters temporal TemporalAccessor: the temporal object used to refine the result, not null Returns ValueRange the range of valid values for this field, not null	__label__-1
If the field is not supported an UnsupportedTemporalTypeException must be thrown.	__label__-1
Otherwise, returns false.	__label__-1
Selects the list item that corresponds to the specified keyboard character and returns true, if there is an item corresponding to that character.	__label__-1
"The object that will generate the parameters can be initialized in two different ways: in an algorithm-independent manner, or in an algorithm-specific manner: The algorithm-independent approach uses the fact that all parameter generators share the concept of a ""size"" and a source of randomness."	__label__-1
The measure of size is universally shared by all algorithm parameters, though it is interpreted differently for different algorithms.	__label__-1
"For example, in the case of parameters for the DSA algorithm, ""size"" corresponds to the size of the prime modulus (in bits)."	__label__-1
When using this approach, algorithm-specific parameter generation values - if any - default to some standard values, unless they can be derived from the specified size.	__label__-1
The other approach initializes a parameter generator object using algorithm-specific semantics, which are represented by a set of algorithm-specific parameter generation values.	__label__-1
To generate Diffie-Hellman system parameters, for example, the parameter generation values usually consist of the size of the prime modulus and the size of the random exponent, both specified in number of bits.	__label__-1
In case the client does not explicitly initialize the AlgorithmParameterGenerator (via a call to an init method), each provider must supply (and document) a default initialization.	__label__-1
For example, the Sun provider uses a default modulus prime size of 1024 bits for the generation of DSA parameters.	__label__-1
For a Window which is not a Frame or Dialog to be focusable, its focusable Window state must be set to true, its nearest owning Frame or Dialog must be showing on the screen, and it must contain at least one Component in its focus traversal cycle.	__label__-1
For a Frame or Dialog to be focusable, its focusable Window state must be set to true.	__label__-1
Returns whether this Window can become the focused Window, that is, whether this Window or any of its subcomponents can become the focus owner.	__label__-1

WARNING: The ElementVisitor interface implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures added to future versions of the Java™ programming language.	__label__-1
An object that indicates whether a method had completed running when a SystemException was thrown.	__label__-1
The class CompletionStatus contains three CompletionStatus instances, which are constants representing each possible completion status: COMPLETED_MAYBE, COMPLETED_NO, and COMPLETED_YES.	__label__-1
It also contains three int members, each a constant corresponding to one of the CompletionStatus instances.	__label__-1
May be thrown by a type visitor to indicate that the visitor was created for a prior version of the language.	__label__-1
These int members make it possible to use a switch statement.	__label__-1
This class is used in Request operations to describe the contexts that need to be resolved and sent with the invocation.	__label__-1
An object containing a modifiable list of String objects that represent property names.	__label__-1
This is done by calling the Context method get_values and supplying a string from a ContextList object as the third parameter.	__label__-1
Provides the core classes for the Java Management Extensions.	__label__-1
"A check box is a graphical component that can be in either an ""on"" (true) or ""off"" (false) state."	__label__-1
Supported operations include: launching the user-default browser to show a specified URI; launching the user-default mail client with an optional mailto URI; launching a registered application to open, edit or print a specified file.	__label__-1
The Desktop class allows a Java application to launch associated applications registered on the native desktop to handle a URI or a file.	__label__-1
Each operation is an action type represented by the Desktop.Action class.	__label__-1
If there is no associated application or the associated application fails to be launched, an exception is thrown.	__label__-1
Note: when some action is invoked and the associated application is executed, it will be executed on the same system as the one on which the Java application was launched.	__label__-1
Entry name prefixes are omitted when storing a keystore.	__label__-1
Returns the currently set Action for this ActionEvent source, or null if no Action is set.	__label__-1

It also provides a clipboard mechanism, which is an object that temporarily holds a transferable object that can be transferred between or within an application.	__label__-1
Provides interfaces and classes for transferring data between and within applications.	__label__-1
"It defines the notion of a ""transferable"" object, which is an object capable of being transferred between or within applications."	__label__-1
When searching for first/last/next/previous Component, if a focus traversal policy provider is encountered, its focus traversal policy is used to perform the search operation.	__label__-1
The clipboard is typically used for copy and paste operations.	__label__-1
Although it is possible to create a clipboard to use within an application, most applications will use the system clipboard to ensure the data can be transferred across applications running on the platform.	__label__-1
The paint event type.	__label__-1
Returns a hashcode for the group's identifier.	__label__-1
Two group identifiers that refer to the same remote group will have the same hash code.	__label__-1
The driver converts this to an SQL TINYINT value when it sends it to the database.	__label__-1
Sets the designated parameter to the given Java byte value.	__label__-1
Otherwise, for a granted or requested permission, it must be one of the following: createMBeanServer Create a new MBeanServer object using the method MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer() or MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer(java.lang.String).	__label__-1

Returns JPopupMenu that assigned for this component.	__label__-1
If this component does not have a JPopupMenu assigned to it and getInheritsPopupMenu is true, this will return getParent().getComponentPopupMenu() (assuming the parent is valid.)	__label__-1
It may also contain a string describing the exception.	__label__-1
It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status.	__label__-1
For example, it can be raised by an ORB if an application makes an ORB-related call without having correctly initialized the ORB first.	__label__-1
This exception indicates that the caller has invoked operations in the wrong order.	__label__-1
Creates a copy of this iterator.	__label__-1
In such a case, an application is absolved from its responsibility to update the system selection Clipboard as described above.	__label__-1
On those platforms, this method will return null.	__label__-1
Typically, this is implemented by installing a FocusListener on all Components which support text selection, and, between FOCUS_GAINED and FOCUS_LOST events delivered to that Component, updating the system selection Clipboard when the selection changes inside the Component.	__label__-1
An application is responsible for updating the system selection whenever the user selects text, using either the mouse or the keyboard.	__label__-1
Gets the preferred size of this text field with the specified number of columns.	__label__-1
Gets the singleton instance of the system selection as a Clipboard object.	__label__-1
Some platforms do not support a system selection Clipboard.	__label__-1
When using these classes, and their subclasses, developers need not write any additional code.	__label__-1
Note that java.awt.TextComponent and javax.swing.text.JTextComponent already adhere to this policy.	__label__-1
Properly updating the system selection ensures that a Java application will interact correctly with native applications and other Java applications running simultaneously on the system.	__label__-1
This returns a color with rgb values 102, 102, and 102, respectively.	__label__-1
Returns the secondary 1 color.	__label__-1

The inputstream must contain the number of characters specified by length otherwise a SQLException will be generated when the PreparedStatement is executed.	__label__-1
Sets the designated parameter to a InputStream object.	__label__-1
When the setBinaryStream method is used, the driver may have to do extra work to determine whether the parameter data should be sent to the server as a LONGVARBINARY or a BLOB	__label__-1
This method differs from the setBinaryStream (int, InputStream, int) method because it informs the driver that the parameter value should be sent to the server as a BLOB.	__label__-1
For details, see Threads and Swing, a section in The Java Tutorial.	__label__-1

This method empties a rowset, as opposed to the close method, which marks the entire rowset as recoverable to allow the garbage collector the rowset's Java VM resources.	__label__-1
This CachedRowSet object should lock until its contents and associated updates are fully cleared, thus preventing 'dirty' reads by other components that hold a reference to this RowSet object.	__label__-1
There are no interactions with the underlying data source, and any rowset content, metadata, and content updates should be non-recoverable.	__label__-1
Any outstanding updates are discarded and the rowset contains no rows after this method is called.	__label__-1
Releases the current contents of this CachedRowSet object and sends a rowSetChanged event to all registered listeners.	__label__-1
It is important that properties such as the command property be relevant to the originating data source from which this CachedRowSet object was originally established.	__label__-1
The metadata, including JDBC properties and Synchronization SPI properties, are maintained for future use.	__label__-1
This CachedRowSet object should be returned to normal behavior after firing the rowSetChanged event.	__label__-1
In addition, the contents cannot be released until all all components reading this CachedRowSet object have completed their reads.	__label__-1
(This is typically implemented by converting the internal address of the object into an integer, but this implementation technique is not required by the Java™ programming language.)	__label__-1
Returns int a hash code value for this object.	__label__-1
The byte-aligned write then starts at the next byte position.	__label__-1
If two objects are equal according to the equals(Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce the same integer result.	__label__-1
It is not required that if two objects are unequal according to the equals(java.lang.Object) method, then calling the hashCode method on each of the two objects must produce distinct integer results.	__label__-1
However, the programmer should be aware that producing distinct integer results for unequal objects may improve the performance of hash tables.	__label__-1
As much as is reasonably practical, the hashCode method defined by class Object does return distinct integers for distinct objects.	__label__-1
Returns a hash code value for the object.	__label__-1
This method is supported for the benefit of hash tables such as those provided by HashMap.	__label__-1

Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate.	__label__-1
If none of these is practical, the overriding class should describe the spliterator's documented policy of binding and structural interference, and should override the stream() and parallelStream() methods to create streams using a Supplier of the spliterator, as in: Stream<E> s = StreamSupport.stream(() -> spliterator(), spliteratorCharacteristics) .	__label__-1
In order to preserve expected laziness behavior for the stream() and parallelStream()} methods, spliterators should either have the characteristic of IMMUTABLE or CONCURRENT, or be late-binding.	__label__-1
Returns Spliterator<K> a Spliterator over the elements in this collection	__label__-1
These requirements ensure that streams produced by the stream() and parallelStream() methods will reflect the contents of the collection as of initiation of the terminal stream operation.	__label__-1

The JVM first attempts to invoke the following method on the agent class: public static void premain(String agentArgs, Instrumentation inst); If the agent class does not implement this method then the JVM will attempt to invoke: public static void premain(String agentArgs); The agent class may also have an agentmain method for use when the agent is started after VM startup.	__label__-1
When the agent is started using a command-line option, the agentmain method is not invoked.	__label__-1
"Therefore, methods whose names begin with ""visit"" may be added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities, classes which extend this class should not declare any instance methods with names beginning with ""visit""."	__label__-1
The agent options are passed as a single string, any additional parsing should be performed by the agent itself.	__label__-1
If the agent cannot be resolved (for example, because the agent class cannot be loaded, or because the agent class does not have an appropriate premain method), the JVM will abort.	__label__-1

Provides the Java 2D classes for defining and performing operations on objects related to two-dimensional geometry.	__label__-1
Some important features of the package include: classes for manipulating geometry, such as AffineTransform and the PathIterator interface which is implemented by all Shape objects.	__label__-1
When processing logging output, if a Handler encounters problems then rather than throwing an Exception back to the issuer of the logging call (who is unlikely to be interested) the Handler should call its associated ErrorManager.	__label__-1
ErrorManager objects can be attached to Handlers to process any error that occurs on a Handler during Logging.	__label__-1
A multiplexing UI used to combine ProgressBarUIs.	__label__-1
"In order to pass namespaced values to transformations, for instance when setting a property or a parameter on a Transformer object, this specification defines that a String ""qname"" object parameter be passed as two-part string, the namespace URI enclosed in curly braces ({}), followed by the local name."	__label__-1

"For more information on Helper files, see ""Generated Files: Helper Files""."	__label__-1
Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__-1
For example, where appropriate, they may contain a NamedValue object to hold the return value or exception, a context, a list of possible exceptions, and a list of context strings that need to be resolved.	__label__-1
When such a new visit method is added, the default implementation in this class will be to call the visitUnknown method.	__label__-1
To ensure that keystore entries are uniquely identified, each entry's alias is prefixed by its keystoreName followed by the entry name separator and each keystoreName must be unique within its domain.	__label__-1

All the following conditions must be met to enable the per-pixel transparency mode for this window: The PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency must be supported by the graphics device where this window is located The window must be undecorated (see Frame.setUndecorated(boolean) and Dialog.setUndecorated(boolean)) The window must not be in full-screen mode (see GraphicsDevice.setFullScreenWindow(Window)) If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than 1.0f, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the UnsupportedOperationException or IllegalComponentStateException will be thrown.	__label__-1
Sets the background color of this window.	__label__-1
If the windowing system supports the PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT translucency, the alpha component of the given background color may effect the mode of operation for this window: it indicates whether this window must be opaque (alpha equals 1.0f) or per-pixel translucent (alpha is less than 1.0f).	__label__-1
When the window is per-pixel translucent, the drawing sub-system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel.	__label__-1

This class defines the Service Provider Interface (SPI) for the AlgorithmParameterGenerator class, which is used to generate a set of parameters to be used with a certain algorithm.	__label__-1
The QueryExp parameter to the method can be any implementation of the interface QueryExp, but it is usually best to obtain the QueryExp value by calling the static methods in this class.	__label__-1
This is particularly true when querying a remote MBean Server: a custom implementation of the QueryExp interface might not be present in the remote MBean Server, but the methods in this class return only standard classes that are part of the JMX implementation.	__label__-1
Constructs query object constraints.	__label__-1
For example, the Sun provider uses a default modulus prime size of 1024 bits for the generation of DSA parameters.	__label__-1

For a proxy created with JMX.newMBeanProxy or JMX.newMXBeanProxy, this means that the method must appear in the Standard MBean or MXBean interface.	__label__-1
Otherwise these methods have the following behavior: toString() returns a string representation of the proxy hashCode() returns a hash code for the proxy such that two equal proxies have the same hash code equals(Object) returns true if and only if the Object argument is of the same proxy class as this proxy, with an MBeanServerInvocationHandler that has the same MBeanServerConnection and ObjectName; if one of the MBeanServerInvocationHandlers was constructed with a Class argument then the other must have been constructed with the same Class for equals to return true.	__label__-1
For example, with the method public List<String> reverse(List<String> list); and given that the mapped type for List<String> is String[], a call to proxy.reverse(someList) will convert someList from a List<String> to a String[], call the MBean operation reverse, then convert the returned String[] into a List<String>.	__label__-1
The method Object.toString(), Object.hashCode(), or Object.equals(Object), when invoked on a proxy using this invocation handler, is forwarded to the MBean server as a method on the proxied MBean only if it appears in one of the proxy's interfaces.	__label__-1
If the InvocationHandler is for an MXBean, then the parameters of a method are converted from the type declared in the MXBean interface into the corresponding mapped type, and the return value is converted from the mapped type into the declared type.	__label__-1

An invocation of this method is equivalent to (but may be more efficient than): getFirstQueuedThread() != Thread.currentThread() && hasQueuedThreads() Note that because cancellations due to interrupts and timeouts may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that some other thread will acquire before the current thread.	__label__-1
Queries whether any threads have been waiting to acquire longer than the current thread.	__label__-1
Likewise, it is possible for another thread to win a race to enqueue after this method has returned false, due to the queue being empty.	__label__-1

If all of the values in the data source are already the values to be persisted, the method acceptChanges does nothing.	__label__-1
After all conflicts have been resolved, an application must call the acceptChanges method again to write resolved values to the data source.	__label__-1
In such cases, it is guaranteed that the writer will succeed in writing changes to the data source when the method acceptChanges is called.	__label__-1
Some provider implementations may use locks to ensure that there are no conflicts.	__label__-1
Note: The acceptChanges() method will determine if the COMMIT_ON_ACCEPT_CHANGES is set to true or not.	__label__-1
This method may be called immediately after the methods updateRow, insertRow, or deleteRow have been called, but it is more efficient to call it only once after all changes have been made so that only one connection needs to be established.	__label__-1
Otherwise, the application must explicity call the commit or rollback methods as appropriate.	__label__-1

Sets the SyncProvider object for this CachedRowSet object to the one specified.	__label__-1
This method allows the SyncProvider object to be reset.	__label__-1
A CachedRowSet implementation should always be instantiated with an available SyncProvider mechanism, but there are cases where resetting the SyncProvider object is desirable or necessary.	__label__-1
For example, an application might want to use the default SyncProvider object for a time and then choose to use a provider that has more recently become available and better fits its needs.	__label__-1
Resetting the SyncProvider object causes the RowSet object to request a new SyncProvider implementation from the SyncFactory.	__label__-1
This has the effect of resetting all previous connections and relationships with the originating data source and can potentially drastically change the synchronization behavior of a disconnected rowset.	__label__-1
Atomically decrements by one the current value of the field of the given object managed by this updater.	__label__-1
This method is intended to be used only for debugging purposes, and the content and format of the returned string may vary between implementations.	__label__-1

Each key references a Vector object that corresponds to one row of a RowSet object.	__label__-1
The TreeMap type of collection guarantees that the map will be in ascending key order, sorted according to the natural order for the key's class.	__label__-1
The standard reference implementation for the CachedRowSet interface uses a TreeMap object for the rowset, with the values in each row being contained in Vector objects.	__label__-1
An SQL NULL column value must be represented as a null in the Java programming language.	__label__-1
Each row must be fully represented in either a general purpose Collection implementation or a specialized Collection implementation, such as a TreeMap object or a Vector object.	__label__-1
Implementations have some latitude in how they can represent this Collection object because of the abstract nature of the Collection framework.	__label__-1
Converts this CachedRowSet object to a Collection object that contains all of this CachedRowSet object's data.	__label__-1
The key used by the TreeMap collection is determined by the implementation, which may choose to leverage a set key that is available within the internal RowSet tabular structure by virtue of a key already set either on the RowSet object itself or on the underlying SQL data.	__label__-1
Therefore, the size of each Vector object must be exactly equal to the number of columns in the RowSet object.	__label__-1

Setting echoChar = 0 allows user input to be echoed to the screen again.	__label__-1
A Java platform implementation may support only a limited, non-empty set of echo characters.	__label__-1
Attempts to set an unsupported echo character will cause the default echo character to be used instead.	__label__-1
Subsequent calls to getEchoChar() will return the echo character originally requested.	__label__-1
This might or might not be identical to the echo character actually used by the TextField implementation.	__label__-1

This is sometimes found in XML messages and other forms of persistence, but contains less information than a full time-zone.	__label__-1
This stores a date-time like '2010-12-03T11:30+01:00'.	__label__-1
OffsetDateTime stores a date and time and offset from UTC.	__label__-1
The registry returns to the calling object a reference to the remote object, using which a remote method can be invoked.	__label__-1
Scrolling containers, like JScrollPane, will use this method each time the user requests a unit scroll.	__label__-1
Components that display logical rows or columns should compute the scroll increment that will completely expose one new row or column, depending on the value of orientation.	__label__-1
This is implemented to use the values returned by the getRowHeight and getColumnWidth methods.	__label__-1
Invoked when the mouse button has been moved on a component (with no buttons no down).	__label__-1

Note that adding a default implementation of a new visit method in a visitor class will occur instead of adding a default method directly in the visitor interface since a Java SE 8 language feature cannot be used to this version of the API since this version is required to be runnable on Java SE 7 implementations.	__label__-1
Once you create a persistence delegate, you register it using the setPersistenceDelegate method of XMLEncoder.	__label__-1

Sets the field of the given object managed by this updater to the given updated value.	__label__-1
This method returns an object that describes the valid range for that value.	__label__-1
This method is generally only applicable to the ISO-8601 calendar system.	__label__-1
Gets the range of valid values for the field.	__label__-1
Returns ValueRange the range of valid values for the field, not null	__label__-1
Note that the result only describes the minimum and maximum valid values and it is important not to read too much into them.	__label__-1
The nesting kind of a type element.	__label__-1
see java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment#getAllFonts	__label__-1
If the method returns true the given state may still be unsupported and/or unavailable for a particular frame.	__label__-1
When XOP encoding is enabled as described in AttachmentMarshaller.isXOPPackage(), this annotation disables datatypes such as Image or Source or byte[] that are bound to base64-encoded binary from being considered for XOP encoding.	__label__-1
Disable consideration of XOP encoding for datatypes that are bound to base64-encoded binary data in XML.	__label__-1

This has no effect if the tree isn't being edited.	__label__-1
Stops the current editing session.	__label__-1
Returns true if the editor allows the editing session to stop.	__label__-1
Notifies all of the listeners registered with this RowSet object that one of its rows has changed.	__label__-1
When an application calls a method that changes a row, such as the CachedRowSet methods insertRow, updateRow, or deleteRow, that method calls notifyRowChanged internally.	__label__-1
A lookup object is a factory for creating method handles, when the creation requires access checking.	__label__-1
Method handles do not perform access checks when they are called, but rather when they are created.	__label__-1
If true, when editing is to be stopped by way of selection changing, data in tree changing or other means stopCellEditing is invoked, and changes are saved.	__label__-1
Returns the advance of this ImageGraphicAttribute.	__label__-1

"Property Name Property Value Standard Java CORBA Properties: org.omg.CORBA.ORBClass class name of an ORB implementation org.omg.CORBA.ORBSingletonClass class name of the ORB returned by init() These properties allow a different vendor's ORB implementation to be ""plugged in."""	__label__-1
When an ORB instance is being created, the class name of the ORB implementation is located using the following standard search order: check in Applet parameter or application string array, if any check in properties parameter, if any check in the System properties check in the orb.properties file located in the user.home directory (if any) check in the orb.properties file located in the java.home/lib directory (if any) fall back on a hardcoded default behavior (use the Java IDL implementation) Note that Java IDL provides a default implementation for the fully-functional ORB and for the Singleton ORB.	__label__-1
A class providing APIs for the CORBA Object Request Broker features.	__label__-1
initializes the ORB implementation by supplying values for predefined properties and environmental parameters obtains initial object references to services such as the NameService using the method resolve_initial_references converts object references to strings and back connects the ORB to a servant (an instance of a CORBA object implementation) and disconnects the ORB from a servant creates objects such as TypeCode Any NamedValue Context Environment lists (such as NVList) containing these objects sends multiple messages in the DII The ORB class can be used to obtain references to objects implemented anywhere on the network.	__label__-1
