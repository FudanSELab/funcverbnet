Reads all of the lines from a Readable object. The lines do not include line-termination characters, but do include other leading and trailing whitespace. Does not close the Readable. If reading files or resources you should use the Files#readLines and Resources#readLines methods.	__label__44

Checks if a String is not empty  and not null.  StringUtils.isNotEmpty = false StringUtils.isNotEmpty = false StringUtils.isNotEmpty = true StringUtils.isNotEmpty = true StringUtils.isNotEmpty = true 	__label__65
check Not Empty	__label__65
Returns true if the given string is null or is the empty string. Consider normalizing your string references with nullToEmpty. If you do, you can use String#isEmpty instead of this method, and you won't need special null-safe forms of methods like String#toUpperCase either. Or, if you'd like to normalize 'in the other direction,' converting empty strings to null, you can use emptyToNull.	__label__54
check Null Or Empty	__label__65
Validate that the specified argument is not null; otherwise throwing an exception. Validate.notNull; The message of the exception is ''The validated object is null''.	__label__65

Removes one newline from end of a String if it's there, otherwise leave it alone. A newline is ''. n'', ''. r'', or ''. r. n''. NOTE: This method changed in 2.0. It now more closely matches Perl chomp.  StringUtils.chomp = null StringUtils.chomp = '' StringUtils.chomp = 'abc ' StringUtils.chomp = 'abc' StringUtils.chomp = 'abc' StringUtils.ch	__label__68
chomp	__label__-1
Returns a substring of the input character sequence that omits all matching BMP characters from the end of the string. For example: CharMatcher.anyOf.trimTrailingFrom  ... returns 'abacat'.	__label__54

Checks if a String is whitespace, empty  or null.  StringUtils.isBlank = true StringUtils.isBlank = true StringUtils.isBlank = true StringUtils.isBlank = false StringUtils.isBlank = false 	__label__65
check Blank	__label__65
Returns true if a character sequence contains only matching BMP characters. The default implementation iterates over the sequence, invoking matches for each character, until this returns false or the end is reached.	__label__54

Checks if a String is empty  or null.  StringUtils.isEmpty = true StringUtils.isEmpty = true StringUtils.isEmpty = false StringUtils.isEmpty = false StringUtils.isEmpty = false  NOTE: This method changed in Lang version 2.0. It no longer trims the String. That functionality is available in isBlank.	__label__65
